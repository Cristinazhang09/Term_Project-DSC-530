This is my term project for DSC-530

According car accidents statistics, there are nearly 6 million car accidents in the United States every year. Approximately 1.25 million people die in road crashed each year, in addition, 20-50 million people are injured, many of them even have long-term disabilities. Due to car accidents, many people lose properties, health, especially, people lose their loved ones. Thus, I determine to analyze a countywide car accident dataset, my goal is to find out the importance of different climatic factors correspond to the accidents and severity.
